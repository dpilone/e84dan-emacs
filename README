This project contains a copy of the customizations I use for emacs.
For a basic emacs install I install Emacs or Aquamacs then install the
emacs starter kit:

git clone https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit.git ~/.emacs.d

Followed by my customizations:

git clone https://github.com/dpilone/e84dan-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d/e84dan-emacs

Then load my customizations with the following in ~/.emacs.d/custom.el:

;; Load my real customizations
(load "e84dan-emacs/e84dan")
